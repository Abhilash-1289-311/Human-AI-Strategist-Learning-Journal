What is Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) in AI?
Imagine a smart robot sorting photos of cats and dogs. Most of the time, it gets it right. But sometimes, it sees a funny-looking cat and says, “That’s a dog!”

With Human-in-the-Loop, whenever the robot is confused or isn’t sure, it asks a human for help. The human checks, says, “Nope, that’s a cat!” The robot learns, gets smarter, and next time, might not make the same mistake.

This way, humans fix mistakes, teach the robot over time, and make sure nothing goes wrong. HITL is used in banks, hospitals, self-driving cars, and customer support—anywhere mistakes are risky or rules are complex.

Real-World Example:
A hospital AI sorts patient test results. If the AI finds results it hasn’t seen before, it asks a doctor to check before sending them out. This keeps patients safe, avoids mistakes, and lets the system learn from experts.

Analogy
Human-in-the-loop is like a pilot flying an airplane with autopilot. The autopilot (AI) handles most of the flying, but the human pilot watches everything, takes control during storms or emergencies, and makes the final decisions—because some situations need human judgment to ensure safety.
