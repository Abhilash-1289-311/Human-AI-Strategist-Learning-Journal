# 07 - Human+AI Workflow Example: Self-Driving Car Safety System ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

Applying the Human+AI Workflow Design Template  
*(Case Study: Where humans and AI share control for safe autonomous driving)*

---

## 1. **Goal**

Operate vehicles safely and efficiently using autonomous AI, while preventing accidents and handling all situations responsibly.

---

## 2. **Workflow Steps**

| Step Number | Step Description                                  | Who Handles?      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1           | Navigate normal roads and recognize traffic signs  | AI                |
| 2           | Detect obstacles or sudden hazards                 | AI                |
| 3           | Encounter ambiguous/complex situations (e.g., new construction, police officer directions) | AI + Human        |
| 4           | AI requests human takeover if unsure or blocked    | Both              |
| 5           | Human driver takes over manual control if needed   | Human             |
| 6           | AI resumes autonomous control when safe            | Both              |

## 3. **Red Flag Checkpoints ðŸš©**

| Step | Red Flag Risk (What Could Go Wrong?)                           | How Human Fixes It                       |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 3    | AI unsure about temporary road layouts (construction, detours) | Human interprets and makes safe choice   |
| 4    | AI misinterprets hand signals from police                      | Human uses personal judgment             |
| 5    | Unexpected weather or sensor failure                           | Human pulls over or takes manual action  |

---

## 4. **Human Review Triggers**

- [x] AI hits uncertainty/confidence below 95%
- [x] Unrecognized obstacle or traffic situation
- [x] Human presses "Take Over" button
- [x] System detects sensor/malfunction

---

## 5. **Feedback & Learning**

- All human interventions (takeovers, corrections) are logged to retrain the AI and improve future autonomous driving.

---

> **Key Lesson:**  
> Even the most advanced AI must know when to "ask for help!" The safest, most reliable systems **always** give humans the final authority in risky situations.
