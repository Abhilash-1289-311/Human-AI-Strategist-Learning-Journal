a. What is an “AI Product Strategist / Human+AI Workflow Designer”?
Imagine a world full of robots (AIs) that can listen, talk, and follow instructions. But sometimes, these robots get confused. They make silly mistakes, or don’t know what people want. An "AI Product Strategist" is like a coach and teacher for these robots—they help them understand people better, and help people work better with robots.

A "Human+AI Workflow Designer" draws the map, showing which tasks robots do, which tasks people do, and how they can pass work back and forth so everything runs smoothly. They make sure robots help people, not make more problems.

b. Why does this job exist in an AI world?
Because robots are smart, but also make mistakes—especially with real people, with emotions, and with rules. We need someone who:

Keeps the robots out of trouble.
Makes sure they're fair and don’t break things or hurt feelings.
Helps humans and robots work together, sharing the jobs in ways that are safe, easy, and useful.
c. What problems do they solve—specifically—which AIs can’t?
Understanding feelings or context: Robots don’t “get” jokes, rules, or why something upsets people.
Judging right/wrong in tricky situations: Sometimes, there’s no clear answer—only a human can judge.
Fixing robot mistakes: If a robot messes up a task, a human steps in, learns from it, and fixes the workflow.
Making robot work trusted: People trust systems more if humans oversee and adjust them—this job gives that trust.
