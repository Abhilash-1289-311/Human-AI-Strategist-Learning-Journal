# 09 - Sample AI Policy: Keeping Humans in the Loop 🛡️🤖

A mini “playbook” for any company using critical AI systems—ensuring oversight, safety, and trust!

---

## Why This Matters

AI is fast, but not always right or fair! For any system with **high stakes** (money, health, law, security), humans must be able to check, veto, or fix AI decisions—every time.

---

## Sample Policy Points

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Mandate

- All high-impact decisions made by AI must be reviewed or approved by a qualified human.

### 2. Transparency & Explainability

- AI must show *why* it makes key decisions so humans can audit or override when needed.

### 3. Escalation Paths

- If the AI hits an edge case, is uncertain, or detects a red flag, it must alert a human operator before proceeding.

### 4. Audit and Logging

- Every critical AI action and every human intervention must be logged for regular auditing.

### 5. Continuous Training

- Human corrections or interventions are used to retrain and improve the AI over time.

## When Do Humans Take Over?

- Whenever the AI shows low confidence (<90%)
- When user requests a human (one-click escalation)
- In all legally or ethically risky scenarios

## Bottom Line

> 🚦 “Humans are the seatbelt for artificial intelligence. We keep AI useful, responsible, and safe.” 🚦
