## What are AI "Failure Modes"?

AI systems are powerful but **not perfect**. Sometimes, they make strange or risky mistakes. These weak points are called **failure modes**—spots where human oversight is essential!

## Key Failure Modes (With Easy Examples)

| 💥 Failure Mode          | 😱 Example                                                    | 🧑‍⚖️ Why Human Intervention Matters                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Bias**                | Loan AI approves more men than women                         | Fairness & legal compliance                        |
| **Hallucination**       | Chatbot invents fake medical advice                          | Fact-checking, safety                              |
| **Edge Case**           | Self-driving car hits a weird animal on the road             | Judgment in rare/unknown situations                |
| **No Common Sense**     | AI recommends wearing a raincoat to a desert wedding         | Context awareness                                  |
| **Ethics Violation**    | AI shares private user data in a public chat                 | Protect privacy, follow ethical rules              |
| **Overconfidence**      | AI gives a 100% sure answer but is actually wrong            | Needs real expert review                           |
| **Ambiguity**           | AI confuses “bank” (money vs. river) and makes mistakes      | Humans clarify intent, avoid critical errors       |

## Key Takeaways 📝

- Even the best AI can get confused, overconfident, or break important rules.
- **Humans are needed** to watch for these problems, fix mistakes, and make sure everything stays fair and safe.

> **Human+AI Workflow Design** = Building systems so **humans catch and fix AI failures before they can cause real damage.**
