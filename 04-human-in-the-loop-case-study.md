# 04 - Human-in-the-Loop Case Study: AI Resume Screening 📝🤖

Understanding how humans and AI work together in real hiring

---

## Real-World Example: AI + Human for Job Applications

### The Basic Workflow

1. **AI scans all resumes:**  
   Quickly filters thousands, finding top matches using keywords, experience, and background.

2. **AI flags “uncertain” resumes:**  
   If a resume is tricky or the AI isn’t sure, it marks it for human review.

3. **Humans (Recruiters) review the shortlist:**  
   They check for fairness, spot great-but-unusual candidates, and correct mistakes in the AI picks.

4. **Final decision by humans:**  
   The best candidates move forward based on human judgment.
